	    <h1>My Running Journey</h1>
	    <p><img src="../images/lexa.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="170" class="floatLEFT"/><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;">I have been running for as long as I can remember, it has always been a big part of who I am.</span> I did track for the first time in elementary school and continued into middle school with school track.I won third place in my 800 meter sprint for Harris Road and there were several other competitive acheivements. I run 400 and 800 meter spritns as my main events. In high school running became my outlet for stress relief.</p>
	    <p>I ran track in my freshman year, and was primarily a sprinter. Over the period we spent at home quarantining I built up my endurance through daily practice and consistent efforts, I built my endurance to be able to run 4.5 miles without stops and I hope to work my way up to a half marathon by the time I finish college. I ran cross country in my sophomore year with my new endurance as well. Running has always been a safe place for me, it keeps me grounded and consistent and helps me build up long term goals. </p>

	    <h1>Where to Start</h1>
	    <p><img src="../images/8grade.jpg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-size: 12pt">So where do you start? Choose a type of running, and if you need to start on the tredmill and work your way up by building your endurance for either type of running. If you are distance running, work you way up in distance aiming for certain milestones like half a mile and then a mile. If you're sprinting work on how long you can run at full speed.</span>Make sure to find the right shoes for your foot type, do some research on what brands are best for you. </p>
	    <p>Ensure that you have a good running schedule that makes room for rest and recovery. Work on a diet plan of some sort to make sure that the exercise you are doing is backed by good nutrition. Finally make sure to have an amazing wardrobe that will get you motivated to go out and run. I always find it best to run with a buddy to keep me motivated, so if needed find a friend to work through the process with you. You're all set! get ready to run with the speed of light and make sure to stretch before and after your runs! </p>
